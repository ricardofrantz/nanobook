## [Unreleased]

### Changed (Breaking, security)

- **`nanobook-rebalancer` audit path sandboxing (S8)**:
  `AuditLog::open` now refuses to write to a path that
  canonicalizes outside the current working directory.
  `canonicalize` is symlink-aware, so a `./logs → /tmp/shared`
  symlink or a `../elsewhere` traversal is rejected with a new
  `Error::AuditPathOutsideWorkdir { path }` variant. The primary
  defense is against symlink-assisted audit-data exfiltration.
  - `AuditLog::open_in(path, workdir)` is a new variant that
    lets callers specify an explicit workdir (used by tests and
    intended for a future `--workdir` CLI flag).
  - Configs with an absolute `logging.dir` outside CWD will
    error at audit open. Migration: move the audit directory
    under CWD, or use a process-level workdir switch such as
    `cd <config-root> && rebalancer …`.

- **`nanobook_risk::RiskEngine::new` (S5)**: Signature changes
  from `-> Self` (panicking) to `-> Result<Self, RiskError>`.
  The old implementation panicked on invalid config — bad for
  Python callers (kills the interpreter with a stack trace) and
  for any code that loads configs from files. New
  `RiskError::InvalidConfig(String)` carries the offending-field
  message suitable for display to a user. Migration: callers
  with static configs use `.expect("config")`; callers with
  user-supplied configs propagate the error.
  - `rebalancer::check_risk` routes the error into the existing
    `RiskReport` failing-check channel (signature unchanged).
  - `python.RiskEngine.__init__` now raises `ValueError` on
    invalid config instead of panicking the interpreter.

- **`Trade::notional` (S4)**: Signature changes from
  `-> i64` to `-> Result<i64, ValidationError>`. The old method
  silently wrapped on `price.0 * (quantity as i64)` overflow,
  turning a large positive product into a negative `i64` (via
  two's-complement wrap) and propagating a financially-absurd
  value into P&L and risk accounting. The new implementation uses
  `checked_mul`; overflow becomes a new
  `ValidationError::NotionalOverflow { price, quantity }` variant
  that carries the offending operands.
- **`Trade::vwap`**: Signature unchanged (`-> Option<Price>`),
  but the internal notional sum is now checked at both the
  per-trade product and the running-sum stage. Any overflow
  returns `None` instead of wrapping silently.
- **Out of scope for this commit** (flagged for a follow-up S
  item): `src/portfolio/position.rs:95,104` have analogous
  `quantity * price` patterns that are not yet checked.

### Changed (Docs)

- **README performance claim (D2)**: The "120 ns submit /
  8M ops/sec" figures were aspirational — v0.9.3 itself
  measured 131 ns, and v0.10.0 measures ~155 ns after N8's
  self-trade prevention added the `Order::owner` field and
  a per-trade STP branch. The README now reports the measured
  v0.10.0 numbers (~155 ns, ~6M ops/sec) with links to
  `benches/README.md` (methodology) and
  `benches/v0.10-comparison.md` (delta). `cargo doc
  --all-features --no-deps -p nanobook -p nanobook-broker
  -p nanobook-risk -p nanobook-rebalancer` runs clean under
  `-D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`; the python binding
  is excluded because its `nanobook` lib name collides with
  the main crate on docs output — tracked as a follow-up.

### Added

- **`benches/v0.10-comparison.md` (D0)**: Pre-tag benchmark
  delta against the v0.9.3 release commit (`bc4c48f`). Nine
  benchmarks crossed the plan's +5 % regression threshold;
  the largest is `submit_no_match` at +18 %, attributable to
  N8's Order-struct growth (`owner: Option<OrderOwner>`,
  +8 bytes) and the per-trade STP branch in the matcher. The
  README's "120 ns submit" claim was already aspirational in
  v0.9.3 (measured 131 ns then, 155 ns now) — scheduled for
  honesty revision under D2. Six benchmarks showed apparent
  large speedups (30 to 56 %) that the report attributes to
  noisy baseline measurement; flagged for re-bench on a
  quiet machine.

- **`fuzz/mutants-baseline.md` (I3)**: First mutation-testing
  baseline for the matching engine using `cargo-mutants` v27.0.0
  against `src/matching.rs`, `src/exchange.rs`, `src/level.rs`.
  Kill rate **89.76 %** (114 / 127 testable mutants) — clears the
  plan's ≥85 % bar. Six regression tests added this commit closed
  7 of the 20 original survivors; the 13 remaining are all
  accessor-equivalent mutations documented in the baseline
  report. Reproduce with
  `cargo mutants -p nanobook --file <file> --timeout 60
  --jobs 4 --all-features`.

- **`fuzz/` cargo-fuzz harness (I2)**: Two libFuzzer targets in a
  new nightly-only workspace isolated from the main workspace via
  `exclude = ["fuzz"]`.
  - `fuzz_submit` drives a fresh `Exchange` with arbitrary
    `SubmitLimit`, `SubmitMarket`, `Cancel`, and `Modify`
    actions; asserts no panic, book never crossed, and order
    IDs strictly monotonic with submission order (including
    FOK-rejected ghost IDs per N7).
  - `fuzz_itch` drains arbitrary bytes through `ItchParser` up
    to 64 messages per input; asserts the S3 "never panic on
    malformed input" contract under coverage-guided
    exploration.
  - Both targets run clean for 50k iterations each in local
    smoke testing; designed for long local soaks and NOT
    CI-gated. `fuzz/README.md` documents manual invocation.

### Fixed (Security)

- **GitHub Actions hardening (I1)**:
  - `ci.yml` and `release.yml` now declare
    `permissions: contents: read` at workflow scope; jobs that
    need elevated permissions (e.g., `release` needing
    `contents: write`) override at job scope. Least-privilege
    by default, regardless of the org's baseline `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    policy.
  - Tool installs are pinned:
    `cargo install cargo-deny --version 0.19.4 --locked`,
    `cargo install cargo-audit --version 0.22.1 --locked`,
    `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --version 0.8.5 --locked`.
    Supply-chain attacks via a compromised publisher account
    can no longer slip into CI via a floating version.
  - `release.yml`'s `cargo publish || true` is replaced with a
    version-gated helper that skips only when crates.io already
    reports the current version, and surfaces all other errors
    (network, auth, malformed manifest).
  - `wheels.yml` now declares `attestations: true` on the PyPI
    publish step for readability; the default was already
    `true` under trusted publishing, but making it explicit
    signals intent.

- **`nanobook-broker` credential scrubbing (S9)**:
  `BinanceBroker` and its internal `BinanceClient` now derive
  [`zeroize::ZeroizeOnDrop`](https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/trait.ZeroizeOnDrop.html).
  On drop, the heap bytes backing `api_key` and `secret_key` are
  overwritten with zeros before the allocator can reclaim them,
  closing the post-free memory-inspection window. Replaces the
  ad-hoc `impl Drop` on `BinanceClient` with the idiomatic
  derive. `#[zeroize(skip)]` is applied to non-credential fields
  (reqwest client, base URL, testnet flag, quote asset) — the
  reqwest `Client` has no `Zeroize` impl and holds no secrets.
  - New `broker/README.md` documents the three things
    zeroization does NOT protect against: runtime reads,
    intermediate buffers in crypto libraries, and the PyO3
    `&str → PyString` caveat. Recommends passing credentials
    via environment variables on the Rust side to avoid
    transiting a `PyString` at all.
  - `IbkrClient` is deliberately NOT `ZeroizeOnDrop` — TWS
    authenticates at the socket layer via `(host, port,
    client_id)` and no credentials live in process memory.

- **`nanobook-rebalancer` audit file (S7)**: The JSONL audit
  file is now created with mode `0o600` on Unix (owner
  read/write only), protecting the position / equity / order
  trail from leaks through shared filesystems, misconfigured
  backups, or lax umask defaults. The mode is applied at file
  creation; pre-existing audit files keep their current
  permissions. On Windows, permissions inherit from the parent
  directory and are not restricted — the audit-file doc-comment
  flags this.
- **`nanobook-broker` IBKR logs (S7)**: Equity, cash,
  buying-power, and position-count `info!` log lines are
  demoted to `debug!`. Financial PII no longer flows to
  aggregated info-level sinks by default; set `RUST_LOG=debug`
  locally when you need the visibility. Connection-status
  logs (`"Connecting to …"`, `"Connected (client_id=…)"`) stay
  at `info!` since they carry no PII.

- **`nanobook-broker` (S6)**: Consolidated the five inline
  "parse f64 string, warn on failure, fall back to 0" blocks
  introduced by S2 into a single `parse::parse_f64_or_warn`
  helper. All warn messages now share a uniform shape
  (`"{field}: failed to parse {raw:?} as f64 ({err}); using 0"`)
  making log-scraping and alert rules simpler. Field tags are
  module-qualified (`"binance balance.free"`,
  `"ibkr account.NetLiquidation"`) so a malformed integration
  partner is identifiable at a glance. No behavior change.

- **`nanobook::itch` (S3)**: NASDAQ ITCH 5.0 message parser no
  longer panics on malformed input. Every `try_into().unwrap()`
  slice read was replaced with a fallible helper
  (`read_u16_be`, `read_u32_be`, `read_u48_be`, `read_u64_be`)
  that returns `io::Error` of kind `InvalidData` on a short
  slice, carrying the field name. The existing `min_payload`
  fast-fail gate is preserved. A proptest covers 1000 randomized
  byte sequences and asserts the parser never panics — important
  because ITCH data comes from external transports where a
  panic is a DoS vector.

- **`nanobook-broker` (S2)**: Float-to-cents conversions at every
  IBKR and Binance boundary are now NaN/overflow-safe. The pattern
  `(value * 100.0) as i64` silently produced `0` on `NaN`,
  `i64::MAX` on `+Inf`, and `i64::MIN` on `-Inf`; garbage upstream
  fields became plausible-looking positions and balances
  downstream. A new `broker::types::f64_cents_checked` (and
  `f64_to_fixed_checked` for other scales like satoshis) rejects
  non-finite and out-of-range inputs as
  `BrokerError::NonFiniteValue` / `BrokerError::ValueOutOfRange`,
  each carrying the upstream field name. Rounding switches from
  truncation to `f64::round` for consistency with N6 and to avoid
  a systematic downward bias on positive money.

### Changed (Breaking, security)

- **`nanobook-broker` (S1)**: Default TLS backend is now `rustls`
  (pure Rust, no `openssl` transitive dependency). The `binance`
  feature no longer activates `native-tls-vendored` on its own.
  New mutually-independent feature flags `rustls` (default) and
  `native-tls` select the backend.
  - Migration:
    - Default users get rustls — no action needed.
    - Callers that relied on system OpenSSL (custom CA bundles via
      `OPENSSL_CONF`, enterprise roots managed through OpenSSL)
      should build with
      `--no-default-features --features "binance native-tls"`.
    - The removal of `native-tls-vendored` also drops the vendored
      OpenSSL source tree from every broker build, so openssl CVEs
      no longer require a broker rebuild-and-republish.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-21 - Honesty Release

### Fixed (Security)

- **IBKR market-order encoding** (`nanobook-broker` 0.4.0, Security-C1):
  Market orders previously encoded as a `$999,999.99` buy / `$0.01` sell
  aggressive limit. On halts, auction crosses, or dark-pool routes this
  could fill at the nominal limit. The IBKR adapter now uses true market
  orders when enabled and removes the sentinel-price shim. A quote-bounded
  encoder remains for explicit fallback behavior, returning
  `BrokerError::NoQuoteForMarketOrder` when no NBBO quote is available.
  Strict rejection mode is available via `--features strict-market-reject`.

### Changed (Breaking)

- **`nanobook-broker` 0.4.0 (Security-H4)**:
  `BrokerOrder` now carries an optional
  `client_order_id: Option<ClientOrderId>`. Deterministic client order IDs
  are derived from `(scope, symbol, side, qty)` and threaded into IBKR
  `orderRef` and Binance `newClientOrderId` for broker-side deduplication
  on retry.
- **`nanobook-rebalancer` 0.5.0**:
  Rebalancer target/config structs and risk config now use
  `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`. Typos in config files, for example
  `max_leverage_pct` instead of `max_leverage`, now error at parse time
  instead of silently using the default. Audit your config files.

### Deprecated

- `nanobook::optimize::optimize_cvar` / `optimize_cdar` are renamed to
  `inverse_cvar_weights` / `inverse_cdar_weights`. The old names continue
  to work with a `DeprecationWarning` / `#[deprecated]` attribute and will
  be removed in 0.11. Migration:
  `sed -i 's/optimize_cvar/inverse_cvar_weights/g; s/optimize_cdar/inverse_cdar_weights/g' <your_files>`.
- `nanobook::garch::garch_forecast` is renamed to `garch_ewma_forecast`.
  The old name gave the false impression of an MLE-fitted model; the
  implementation uses fixed EWMA-style parameters.

### Added

- `nanobook-broker` 0.4.0: deterministic `ClientOrderId` tagged into IBKR
  `orderRef` and Binance `newClientOrderId`.
- `nanobook-broker` 0.4.0: `strict-market-reject` feature flag.
- Python 3.14-compatible PyO3 bindings and CI/wheel coverage.
- Tracked Rust and Python lockfiles for repeatable CI/test dependency
  resolution.

### Docs

- Added "What nanobook is NOT" block in README to clarify scope versus
  NautilusTrader, LEAN, Hummingbot, CCXT, vectorbt, and Riskfolio-Lib.
- Added `benches/README.md` documenting exact latency-measurement
  methodology and noting that README latency numbers are not end-to-end
  live-trading latencies.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Risk engine hard caps** (`nanobook-risk` 0.4.0):
  - `max_order_value_cents` — per-order notional limit (single-order and batch checks)
  - `max_batch_value_cents` — aggregate batch notional limit
  - Config validation for both fields
  - Python bindings: `RiskEngine(max_order_value_cents=..., max_batch_value_cents=...)`
- **Rebalancer execution guardrail** (`nanobook-rebalancer` 0.4.0):
  - `enforce_max_orders_per_run()` — aborts rebalance when generated orders exceed `max_orders_per_run` config
  - Config validation: `max_orders_per_run` must be > 0

### Changed

- **Rebalancer risk centralization** (`nanobook-rebalancer` 0.4.0):
  - Replaced ~140 lines of hand-rolled risk checks with delegation to `nanobook-risk` crate
  - Re-exports `RiskReport`/`RiskCheck`/`RiskStatus` from shared risk crate
- **Broker abstraction** (`nanobook-rebalancer` 0.4.0):
  - New `BrokerGateway` trait decouples execution from IBKR internals
  - `connect_ibkr()` returns `Box<dyn BrokerGateway>` instead of concrete `IbkrClient`
  - `as_connection_error()` helper replaces repeated `.map_err(...)` chains

### Removed

- **CI: MIRI job** — removed from CI pipeline (stale nightly cache issues; core matching engine already well-tested via property tests and integration tests)

### Fixed

- **README**: documented that `max_drawdown_pct` is validated at construction but not yet enforced at execution time

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **CI: Linux wheels** — switched `reqwest` to `native-tls-vendored` (statically linked OpenSSL); eliminates system OpenSSL dependency in manylinux containers and avoids `ring` aarch64 cross-compilation issues
- **CI: Windows wheels** — pinned Python to 3.13 and replaced `--find-interpreter` with explicit `--interpreter python3.13`; PyO3 0.24.x does not support Python 3.14
- **CI: crates.io publish** — made publish step idempotent (`|| true` per crate) so already-published versions don't fail the job
- **Clippy** — fixed `needless_range_loop` and `excessive_precision` warnings in `src/optimize.rs`

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

  - All exposed to Python via PyO3
- **Extended backtest bridge** for qtrade integration:
  - `py_capabilities()` — feature probing contract
  - Stop-aware `backtest_weights(..., stop_cfg=...)` with stop-loss/trailing support
  - Backtest payload extensions: `holdings`, `symbol_returns`, `stop_events`
- **Python v0.9 aliases** in `__init__.py` for clean import paths

### Fixed

- **Python bindings**: All new functions exposed via PyO3 with NumPy integration
- **Property tests**: Hypothesis-based tests for indicators, stats, CV (44 new tests)
- **Reference tests**: Validation against ta-lib, scipy, sklearn

### Changed

- **Performance optimizations**:
  - Rolling metrics use O(N) running sums instead of O(N×K) window iteration
  - RSI/MACD eliminate 3 Vec allocations in hot paths
  - CVaR computes tail mean on iterator (no intermediate Vec)
- **Code quality**: Extracted helper functions to reduce duplication
  - Binance client: `check_response()`, `validate_query_params()`
  - Risk checks: `cmp_symbol()`, `ratio_or_inf()`, `exposure()`
  - Indicators: `rsi_from_avgs()` (de-duplicated seed + loop logic)
  - Metrics: `rolling_window()` shared by rolling Sharpe/volatility

### Fixed

- **Security (audit findings)**:
  - Validated Binance query params to prevent URL parameter injection
  - Safe `u64→i64` casts in risk checks with `try_from()` + `saturating_mul()`
  - Used `saturating_abs()` to fix negative price bypass and `i64::MIN` panic
  - Fail all risk checks when equity ≤ 0 (was silently passing, incorrect)
  - Guard `CostModel` `u128→i64` cast with `try_from()`
  - Zeroize Binance API keys on drop (prevents leak in debug/logs)
  - Redact order params from debug logs (prevent sensitive data leak)
- **Correctness**:
  - CV splits now match sklearn: `test_starts = range(n - k*test_size, n, test_size)`
  - MACD: align fast EMA start with slow EMA for correct initialization
  - CVaR: use parametric VaR (`norm.ppf`) matching quantstats convention
  - Spearman p-value: custom incomplete beta via Newton-Raphson `betacf` + symmetry
- **Overflow safety**: Portfolio `execute_fill()` uses `saturating_abs/mul/sub`
- **Clippy**: Fixed `iter_cloned_collect`, `needless_range_loop`, `excessive_precision`, `inconsistent_digit_grouping`

### Removed

- **ta-lib dependency**: All indicators reimplemented in pure Rust (breaking change if using C library directly)

  - `rebalance_lob()` — route through real LOB matching engines
  - `record_return()`, `snapshot()`, `current_weights()`, `equity_curve()`
- **Financial metrics** (feature: `portfolio`):
  - `compute_metrics()` — Sharpe, Sortino, CAGR, max drawdown, Calmar, volatility
  - `Metrics` struct with `Display` for formatted output
- **Parallel sweep** (feature: `parallel`):
  - `sweep()` — rayon-based parallel parameter sweep over strategy configurations
- **Book analytics**:
  - `BookSnapshot::imbalance()` — order book imbalance ratio
  - `BookSnapshot::weighted_mid()` — volume-weighted midpoint price
  - `Trade::vwap()` — volume-weighted average price across trades
- **Examples**: `portfolio_backtest`, `multi_symbol_lob`
- **Tests**: `portfolio_invariants` integration test suite

### Changed

- `Symbol` added to core types (not feature-gated)
- `MultiExchange` added to public API (not feature-gated)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Stop orders**: Stop-market and stop-limit orders with automatic triggering
  - `submit_stop_market()` — triggers market order on price threshold
  - `submit_stop_limit()` — triggers limit order on price threshold
  - Cascading triggers with depth limit (max 100 iterations)
  - `cancel()` works on both regular and stop orders
  - New types: `StopOrder`, `StopStatus`, `StopBook`, `StopSubmitResult`
- **Input validation**: `try_submit_limit()` and `try_submit_market()` with `ValidationError`
  - `ZeroQuantity` — quantity must be > 0
  - `ZeroPrice` — price must be > 0 for limit orders
- **Serde support**: Optional `serde` feature flag adds `Serialize`/`Deserialize` to all public types
- **Persistence**: Optional `persistence` feature for file-based event sourcing
  - `exchange.save(path)` / `Exchange::load(path)` — JSON Lines format
  - `save_events()` / `load_events()` — lower-level API
- **Examples**: `basic_usage`, `market_making`, `ioc_execution`
- **CLI commands**: `stop`, `stoplimit`, `save`, `load`

### Changed

- `cancel()` now checks stop book before regular order book
- `clear_order_history()` also clears triggered/cancelled stop orders
- Event enum extended with `SubmitStopMarket` and `SubmitStopLimit` variants

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-05

Initial release of nanobook - a deterministic limit order book and matching engine.

### Added

- **Core types**: `Price`, `Quantity`, `Timestamp`, `OrderId`, `TradeId`, `Side`
- **Order management**: Limit orders, market orders, cancel, and modify operations
- **Time-in-force**: GTC (good-til-cancelled), IOC (immediate-or-cancel), FOK (fill-or-kill)
- **Matching engine**: Price-time priority with partial fills and price improvement
- **Event logging**: Optional replay capability via feature flag (`event-log`)
- **Snapshots**: L2 order book depth snapshots
- **CLI binary**: Interactive `lob` command for exploration
- **Examples**: `demo` (interactive) and `demo_quick` (non-interactive)
- **Benchmarks**: Criterion-based throughput and latency measurements
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing (Ubuntu/macOS), linting, and releases
- **Multi-platform releases**: Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Intel, Silicon), Windows

### Performance

- 8.3M orders/sec submission throughput (no match)
- 5M orders/sec with matching
- Sub-microsecond latencies (120ns submit, 1ns BBO query)
- O(1) best bid/ask queries via caching
- FxHash for fast order lookups

### Technical

- Rust 2021 edition, MSRV 1.70 (upgraded to Rust 2024 / MSRV 1.85 in v0.5.0)
- Minimal dependencies: `thiserror`, `rustc-hash`
- Fixed-point price representation (avoids floating-point errors)
- Deterministic via monotonic timestamps (not system clock)
